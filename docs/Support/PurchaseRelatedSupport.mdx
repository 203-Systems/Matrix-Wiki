# Purchase Related Support

## Purchase Inquiries

If you have any questions about your purchases, please contact us at [null@203.io](mailto:null@203.io). We will respond to your inquiry as soon as possible.

## Returns

If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can return it within 30 days of purchase.

We will try our best to make sure you are satisfied with your purchase and want to make sure your return will cost you as little as possible. However, due to the complexity and cost of international shipping, international returns will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

## Warranty & Repair

All 203 products come with a minimum 1-year warranty, or longer if required by local law. If you experience any issues with your product and require repair, please contact us at [null@203.io](mailto:null@203.io).

Additionally, you can purchase individual parts from our [store](https://store.203.io) to repair your product. We will do our best to assist with any repair requests or DIY repair support, even if the product is out of warranty. However, please note that you will be responsible for the repair and shipping costs if the product is out of warranty.

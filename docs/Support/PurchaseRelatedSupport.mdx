# Purchase Related Support

## Purchase
If you have any questions about your purchases, please let me know at [Null@203.io](mailto:null@203.io) and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

## Return 
If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can return it within 30 days of purchase. 

We will try our best to make sure you are satisfied with your purchase and want to make sure your return will cost you as little as possible. However, since international shipping is expensive and arrange international return is complicated, we will have to handle international return case by case.

## Warranty & Repair
All 203 products come with at least 1-year warranty or longer if your local law requires it. 

If you have any issue with your product and need it to be repaired, please let me know by sending a inquiry to [Null@203.io](mailto:null@203.io). 

In addition, you can purchase individual parts from our [store](https://store.203.io) to repair your product. 

We will try our best to assist any repair request or DIY repair supports even if it is out of warranty. However, please note that you will be responsible for the repair cost and shipping cost if it is out of warranty.

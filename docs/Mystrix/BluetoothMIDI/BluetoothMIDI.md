# Bluetooth MIDI

Mystrix supports Bluetooth MIDI, allowing you to connect your Mystrix wirelessly to your devices. You can toggle Bluetooth MIDI on and off in the <DocLink to="/docs/Mystrix/MystrixSpecific/DeviceSettings">Device Settings</DocLink>.

## iOS

In supported apps, you should be able to see a Bluetooth MIDI device menu. In this menu, you should see the Mystrix device. Select it to connect.

For example, see [how to connect Mystrix to GarageBand](https://support.apple.com/guide/garageband-iphone/a-bluetooth-midi-device-touch-instruments-chse356a0321/ios).

## Android

You will need an app to connect Mystrix to your Android device. We recommend [Bluetooth MIDI Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bluetooth.midi.connect&hl=en_US) for this purpose.

## macOS

Refer to [Set up Bluetooth MIDI devices in Audio MIDI Setup on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/audio-midi-setup/set-up-bluetooth-midi-devices-ams33f013765/mac) for instructions.

## Windows

Windows currently has limited support for Bluetooth MIDI. Bluetooth MIDI is only supported in UWP apps, which means you can only use it in Windows Store apps and not in your DAW or browsers.

There are some workarounds, but they are not recommended as they are complicated and not stable. If you are up for it, here is a [guide](http://newbodyfresher.linclip.com/how-to-use-with-daw).

However, this might be changing soon. Apparently, the MIDI system engineer (also a Mystrix owner) is working on a new MIDI system that will support Bluetooth MIDI. Fingers crossed that it will be released soon.

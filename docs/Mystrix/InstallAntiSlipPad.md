# Install the Anti-Slip Pad

<!-- idea: video here would be perfect -->

The first thing you should do is apply the included silicon anti-slip pad from the packaging to your Mystrix.

We are unable to install it in the factory due to regulatory reasons, as we need to conceal the metal device information label under the pad to keep it clean and prevent wear and scratches.

## Important Pre-Installation Steps

:::note Alternate Function Key
If you have an alternate Function Key you want to install (like the one that came with the Kickstarter), make sure you install this prior to installing the anti-slip pad.

:::note Micro SD Card Installation
If you plan to use Python applications in Matrix OS 3, you'll also need to install a Micro SD card before applying the anti-slip pad. See [Install Micro SD Card](./InstallMicroSD) for detailed instructions on how to open your device and install the SD card.

:::warning Loose Magnets
Some magnets under the device might have come loose during shipping. You can glue them back on or just place them in and then apply the anti-slip pad.
However, make sure the polarity of the magnets are facing the same way. The side of the magnet with the dried glue should face the device and not the anti-slip pad.

## Installation Process

To install the anti-slip pad, turn the Mystrix face down and peel the clear protective sheet off the bottom. Align the anti-slip pad (making sure the curved edge is aligned with the pogo pins) and press firmly.

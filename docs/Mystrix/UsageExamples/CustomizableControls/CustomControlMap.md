# Custom Control Map

Matrix OS Custom Control Map allows you to bring your setup on the go without any configuration on other devices. You can set your Mystrix to send out keyboard key presses and MIDI in a powerful arrangement.

<!-- idea: showcase in a gif? maybe opening apps, switching scenes in obs idk -->

For more information on this APP, see <DocLink to="/docs/MatrixOS/Applications/CustomControlMap/">Custom Control Map</DocLink>.

# Custom Control Map

Matrix OS Custom Control Map allow you to bring your set up on the go without any configuration on other devices. You can set your Mystrix to send out keyboard key press and midi in a powerful arrangement.

This feature is currently under neta for Matrix OS 2.6, but you can try out the best version of the editor at https://edit.203.io with the OS 2.6 beta firmware.
See [Custom Control Map](/docs/MatrixOS/Applications/CustomControlMap/)

You can also try out BitFocus Companion integration for similar use cases (but host software required) - [BitFocus Companion](/docs/Mystrix/UsageExamples/CustomizableControls/BitFocusCompanion)

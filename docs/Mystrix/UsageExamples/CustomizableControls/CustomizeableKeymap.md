# Customizable Keymap

Customizable keypad allow you to bring your set up on the go without any configuration on other devices. You can set your Mystrix to send out keyboard key press and midi in a powerful arrangement.

This feature is currently under limited feature preview for Matrix OS 2.6, but you can try out the best version of the editor at https://edit.203.io with the OS 2.6 nightly firmware.

For now, try out BitFocus Companion integration for similar use cases (but host software required) - [BitFocus Companion](/docs/Mystrix/UsageExamples/CustomizableControls/BitFocusCompanion)

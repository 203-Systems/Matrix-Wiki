# Ableton Live

:::info[Feature In Development]
Currently, Mystrix **does not have** native Ableton Live integration via MIDI Remote Script. However, this is something we are actively exploring, **and we would [appreciate your feedback](/docs/Support/ConnectWithUs) on what features you would like to see in an Ableton Live integration.**
:::

You can still use Mystrix as a MIDI controller in Ableton Live by utilizing the MIDI Learn feature in Ableton Live with the [Performance APP](/docs/MatrixOS/Applications/Performance). This allows you to map the controls of Mystrix to parameters in Ableton Live or use it as a drum pad.

Additionally, you can use Mystrix in the [Note APP](/docs/MatrixOS/Applications/Note), enabling you to use Mystrix as a customizable musical controller.

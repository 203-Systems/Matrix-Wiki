# Ableton Live

Mystrix currently does not have a native Ableton Live integration via MIDI Remote Script. However, this is something that we are looking into and would love to hear your feedback on what you would like to see in an Ableton Live integration.

You can always use Mystrix as a MIDI controller in Ableton Live by using the MIDI Learn feature in Ableton Live with [Performance APP](/docs/MatrixOS/Applications/Performance). This will allow you to map the controls of Mystrix to the parameters in Ableton Live or just a plain drumpad.

You can also use Mystrix in the [Note APP](/docs/MatrixOS/Applications/Note). This will allow you to use Mystrix as a musical controller.

# Other Things to Try

## Aura

[Aura](https://aura.town) is a cool web platform that allows you to experiment with music with intuitive and fun.

The Arua grid explores harmonic relationships on a square grid. Sounds complicated, but it's actually fun to play music on that thing. 

The Aura Grid app fully supports Mystrix. You will just have to open the web page on an webmidi enabled browser and connect Mystrix. It should auto detect and connect.

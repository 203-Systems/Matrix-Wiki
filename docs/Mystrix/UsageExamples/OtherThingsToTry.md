# Other Things to Try

## Aura

<!-- proper image showcasing what it does -->

[Aura](https://aura.town) is an innovative web platform that allows you to experiment with music in an intuitive and enjoyable way.

The Aura grid explores harmonic relationships on a square grid. While it may sound complex, it is actually quite fun to play music on it.

The Aura Grid app fully supports Mystrix. Simply open the web page on a [WebMIDI-enabled browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MIDIAccess#Browser_compatibility) and connect your Mystrix. It should auto-detect and connect seamlessly.

# Welcome to Mystrix

Mystrix is a multipurpose grid controller, designed to be community-centric, highly customizable, and fully open-sourced.

<!-- idea: very cool intro/hero image here -->

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

The first steps to get your Mystrix ready for use are:

1. **[Install the Anti-Slip Pad](./InstallAntiSlipPad)** - Apply the included anti-slip pad to the bottom of your device
2. **[Install Micro SD Card](./InstallMicroSD)** - Required to use Python applications in Matrix OS 3

### Update to the Latest OS

See [Update Matrix OS](./UpdateMatrixOS) for instructions on how to update your Mystrix to the latest OS. Since Matrix OS is constantly updated, make sure you are on the latest OS and have the latest documentation to start using your Mystrix!

### Start Using Your Mystrix

See the [Use your Mystrix](../category/use-your-mystrix) section for what others are using Mystrix for and how to get started with them, or dive deep into everything [Matrix OS](../MatrixOS/MatrixOSBasics) has to offer!

## What to Expect

<!-- idea: idk how to rewrite this in a better way lmao -->

Mystrix is powerful and versatile, but here are a few things to keep in mind as you get started:

- **No programming required**: You can jump right in and use it, even customize features, without any coding knowledge whatsoever.
- **Feature-rich by design**: Mystrix offers many capabilities, and some might not be relevant to your particular use case. Our goal is to make it flexible enough so everyone can find their perfect workflow.
- **Continuously improving**: Project Mystrix is actively evolving, and we'll be honestâ€”there are still areas we're polishing. We're constantly improving based on community feedback to make it even better!

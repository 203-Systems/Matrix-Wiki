# Welcome to your new Mystrix

Mystrix is a multipurpose grid controller, designed to be community centric, highly customizable, and fully open sourced. 

## Getting Started

### Set up your Mystrix
First thing you should do is to apply the included silicon anti slip pad in the packaging to your Mystrix.

We can not apply it in the factory because we want to hide the metal device info label under the pad so it appear cleaner and pervert the label from wear and scratches.


### Update to the latest OS
See [Update Matrix OS](/docs/Mystrix/MystrixSpecific/UpdateMatrixOS) on how to update your Mystrix to the latest OS. Since Matrix OS is constantly updated, make sure you are on the latest OS and latest documentation is the key to start using your Mystrix!

### Start using your Mystrix
See the Usage Examples section to see what others are using Mystrix for and how to get started with them or deep dive into [Matrix OS](/docs/MatrixOS/MatrixOSBasics)!

# Welcome to your new Mystrix

Mystrix is a multipurpose grid controller, designed to be community centric, highly customizable, and fully open sourced. 

## Getting Started

### Install the Anti Slip Pad
First thing you should do is to apply the included silicon anti slip pad in the packaging to your Mystrix.

We can not apply it in the factory because we want to hide the metal device info label under the pad so it appear cleaner and prevent the label from wear and scratches.

Some magnet under the device might have came loose during shipping, you can glue it back on or just place it in and then apply the anti slip pad. Make sure the side with glue is facing the device!

### Update to the latest OS
See [Update Matrix OS](/docs/Mystrix/MystrixSpecific/UpdateMatrixOS) on how to update your Mystrix to the latest OS. Since Matrix OS is constantly updated, make sure you are on the latest OS and latest documentation is the key to start using your Mystrix!

### Start using your Mystrix
See the Usage Examples section to see what others are using Mystrix for and how to get started with them or deep dive into everything [Matrix OS](/docs/MatrixOS/MatrixOSBasics) has to offer!

## Expectation

There are a lot of things Mystrix can do and is capable of, but it's important to set an correct expectation.

- There are indeed a lot of things Mystrix & Matrix OS is capable of.

- No, you don't need programming skill to use or even tinkering with Mystrix.

- Yes, a lot of things are going to be irrelevant to you are want or might be doing. They are not trying to make the device more "professional oriented" or the opposite. Having options is a good thing!

- Yes, Project Mystrix is an on going process, there are a lot of stuffs we want to be working on, there are still rough edges on the project, it will be more mature with your help! We are here to heard and improve from your feedbacks!

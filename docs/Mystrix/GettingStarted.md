# Welcome to Mystrix

Mystrix is a multipurpose grid controller, designed to be community-centric, highly customizable, and fully open-sourced.

<!-- very cool intro/hero image here -->

## Getting Started

### Install the Anti-Slip Pad

<!-- video here would be perfect -->

The first thing you should do is apply the included silicon anti-slip pad from the packaging to your Mystrix.

We are unable to install it in the factory due to regulatory reasons, as we need to conceal the metal device information label under the pad to keep it clean and prevent wear and scratches.

Some magnets under the device might have come loose during shipping. You can glue them back on or just place them in and then apply the anti-slip pad.

:::warning
Make sure the side with glue is facing the device!

## Expectations

<!-- idk how to rewrite this in a better way lmao -->

There are a lot of things Mystrix can do and is capable of, but it's important to set the correct expectations.

- No, you don't need programming skills to use or even tinker with Mystrix.
- Yes, some features might not be relevant to your specific needs. We are not trying to appeal to a specific group of people, but rather making Mystrix versatile so it can be used by anyone for whatever needs they have. Having options is a good thing!
- Yes, Project Mystrix is an ongoing process. There are many things we want to improve, and there are still some rough edges. With your help, it will continue to evolve! We are here to listen and improve based on your feedback!

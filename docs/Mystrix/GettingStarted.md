# Welcome to your new Mystrix

Mystrix is a multipurpose grid controller, designed to be community centric, highly customizable, and fully open sourced. 

## Getting Started

First thing you should do is to apply the included silicon anti slip pad in the packaging to your Mystrix.

We can not apply it in the factory because we want to hide the metal device info label under the pad so it appear cleaner and prevert the label from wear and scretches.

## Matrix OS

The Mystrix section will cover basic usage of the Mystrix and Matrix OS.

Matrix OS is the soul of Mystrix, enabling Mystrix to be multi purpose and have enhanced standalone capabilities. All software features are shipped as Matrix OS applications and be mostly independent of each other.

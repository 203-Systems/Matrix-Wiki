# Common Q&A

### Q: Where is 203 Systems based?

203 Systems is based in the US. It is currently run by me, Nengzhuo Cai (also known as Null). 203 is not a full-time job yet, and I move from place to place, so there is no single physical location.

### Q: How do I get started with Mystrix?

Please refer to the [quick start guide](./GettingStarted) for Mystrix.

### Q: Why is the Mystrix labeled as Matrix on the box?

Mystrix underwent a branding change in 2024; the box was not reprinted.

### Q: Why is the magnet falling out? What are the extra pieces in the box?

I only made one batch of Mystrix in 2023, so the units being sold are still from that original batch. The hot glue degraded while they were in storage, so the magnets might fall out during shipping. No need to worry—just put them back in and then install the pad.

There is a metal function key replacement as the special gift for Mystrix batch 1. There has not been a batch 2 yet, so all existing Mystrix units come with it.

### Q: Why is the bottom pad not pre-installed?

For legal reasons, the device information plaque cannot be covered up out of the box. The pads are shipped separately to comply with this rule.

### Q: Why is there no documentation or quick start guide in the box?

Mystrix batch 1 started production months before the first delivery for the Kickstarter. By the time they were in production, the documentation was not ready. Mystrix also undergoes constant updates, so any included printed documentation would quickly become outdated.

### Q: What is the main focus of Mystrix? It seems very open-ended with no clear focus.

The ultimate goal for Mystrix is to be a highly customizable and flexible platform for music applications. We are not there yet, and we need practical steps to pave the way.

Mystrix 1 launched as a regular MIDI controller that served as a platform for the community to build upon. After years of work, it is now capable of more than just MIDI control and can function as a standalone component in a music studio setup with features like the advanced note app, customizable control map, and sequencer.

### Q: What are you doing differently for Mystrix 2?

The software capabilities of Mystrix have drastically outgrown the hardware, so it is time for Mystrix 2, with a more premium build, better I/O options, refined control options, and an internal battery.

We will continue advancing Mystrix for years to come, so in the future we may have enough capabilities to make other focused products like a groove box, standalone sequencer, and other specialized devices.

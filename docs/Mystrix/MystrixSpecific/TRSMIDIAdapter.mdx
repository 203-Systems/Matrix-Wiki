# TRS MIDI Adapter

You can purchase a TRS MIDI adapter (Type A / B) to use with Mystrix at [our store](https://203.io/products/matrix-midi-out-adapter)

The Type A adapter is label as "Type A" while the Type B adapter is unlabeled.

## Use the adapter

1. Connect the adapter's USB C male connector to the Mystrix's USB C female connector.
2. Connect MIDI TRS cable and USB C cable for power/data to the adapter.
3. In most common cases, the adapter will be automatically detected by the Matrix OS and most midi signal will be routed to the USB and the TRS port.

## Addition information

### Better MIDI adapter
The existing MIDI port adapter is more a quick solution for users who need to connect their Mystrix to a MIDI device. 

In the future, we might release an actual dongle that can be connected to the Mystrix's USB C port to provide MIDI in and out ports or even CV ports.

If that actually end up happening, we will provide credit for everyone who purchased the existing MIDI port adapter.

### Matrix OS routing
Mystrix & Matrix OS can sense the existence of the adapter and will automatically route the MIDI signal to the adapter.

Matrix OS applications also have the ability to route the MIDI signal to the adapter or the USB port, it's not a simple mirroring.

You can learn more about the MIDI routing system in the Matrix OS MIDI API [here](/docs/Developer/MatrixOSApplicationAPI/MIDI) if you want to developing your own application that uses advanced MIDI routing with the adapter.

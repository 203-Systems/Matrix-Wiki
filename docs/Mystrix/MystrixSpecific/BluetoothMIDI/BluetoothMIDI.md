# Bluetooth MIDI

Mystrix supports Bluetooth MIDI, which means you will be able to connect your Mystrix wirelessly to your devices!
You can toggle the Bluetooth MIDI on and off in the [Device Setting](/docs/Mystrix/MystrixSpecific/DeviceSettings).

## Connect to iOS device
In supported apps, you should be able to see a Bluetooth MIDI device menu. In it you should see the Mystrix device, select it to connect.

[Example of connecting Mystrix to GarageBand](https://support.apple.com/guide/garageband-iphone/a-bluetooth-midi-device-touch-instruments-chse356a0321/ios)

## Connect to Android device

You will need an APP to connect Mystrix to your Android device. We recommend [Bluetooth MIDI Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bluetooth.midi.connect&hl=en_US) for this purpose.

## Conneect to MacOS device

See [Set up Bluetooth MIDI devices in Audio MIDI Setup on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/audio-midi-setup/set-up-bluetooth-midi-devices-ams33f013765/mac)

## Connect to Windows device
Windows is currently not playing well with Bluetooth MIDI. Bluetooth MIDI is only supported in UWP apps, which means you can only use it in Windows Store apps and not your DAW or your browsers.

There are some workarounds, but they are not recommended as they are complicated and not stable. [If you are up for it, here is a guide](http://newbodyfresher.linclip.com/how-to-use-with-daw).

However, this might be changing soon. Appearently the MIDI system engineer (also a Mystrix owner) is working on a new MIDI system that will support Bluetooth MIDI. Finger crossed that it will be released soon.

# Update Matrix OS 

## Enter OS Update Mode
Mystrix can enter OS update mode in two ways:

1. Use the red button on the bottom left of the setting menu.
2. Hold down the function key while plug in Mystrix. (If you can't boot into the OS, this is your back up)

You should see an arrow on the Mystrix. If the arrow is red, it means that the device is  not connected via USB. If the arrow is green, it means that the device is connected via USB and is ready to receive a new OS.

## Upload New OS

You will also need a new firmware file to update your Mystrix. You can find them in the [release section of the Matrix OS Github](https://github.com/203-Systems/MatrixOS/releases).

Mystrix will show up as a USB mass storage drive in your host device. Simply copy the UF2 file of your desired OS into this drive.

Your Mystrix should start showing a blue arrow animation. Once the updated is completed,mystrix will auto reboot into the new OS.

:::warning[Downgrade Matrix OS]
While you can downgrade Matrix OS, this is not recommended and the downgraded OS might clear all user data. If you downgrade the OS to a version that is not compatible your device, you might not be able to boot into the OS.

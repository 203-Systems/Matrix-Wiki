# Keypad Calibration

:::danger
This feature is intended for advanced users and is not recommended for general users.

Incorrect calibration of the keypad may result in unexpected device behavior. In the worst case, you may need to reflash the OS and wipe all data to recover the device.
:::

:::info
This feature is only available for Mystrix devices with a force-sensitive keypad, such as the Mystrix Pro.
:::

This app allows users to calibrate the keypad according to their preferences by adjusting the minimal and maximal trigger forces.

# Matrix OS

Matrix OS is the operating system that runs on Mystrix. It provides the built-in apps (like Note, Performance, Sequencer, and Strum), system settings, and the software platform that makes Mystrix a flexible music controller.

In short: **Mystrix is the hardware**, and **Matrix OS is the software**.

To learn how Matrix OS works and how to navigate the UI, see <DocLink to="/docs/MatrixOS/MatrixOSBasics">Matrix OS Basics</DocLink>.

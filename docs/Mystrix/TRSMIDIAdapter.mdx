# TRS MIDI Adapter

You can purchase a TRS MIDI adapter (Type A / B) for use with Mystrix at [our store](https://203.io/products/matrix-midi-out-adapter).

The Type A adapter is labeled as `Type A`, while the Type B adapter is **unlabeled**.

## Using the Adapter

1. Connect the adapter's USB-C male connector to the Mystrix's USB-C female connector.
2. Connect the MIDI TRS cable and USB-C cable for power/data to the adapter.
3. In most cases, the adapter will be automatically detected by Matrix OS, and most MIDI signals will be routed to the USB and TRS ports.

## Additional Information

### Matrix OS Routing

Mystrix and Matrix OS can detect the presence of the adapter and will automatically route the MIDI signal to the adapter.

Matrix OS applications also have the ability to route the MIDI signal to the adapter or the USB port, providing more than just simple mirroring.

You can learn more about the MIDI routing system in the Matrix OS MIDI API <DocLink to="/docs/Developer/MatrixOSApplicationCppAPI/MIDI">here</DocLink> if you want to develop your own application that uses advanced MIDI routing with the adapter.

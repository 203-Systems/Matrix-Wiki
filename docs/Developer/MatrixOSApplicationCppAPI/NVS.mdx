# NVS API

## Overview
The Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) API provides a mechanism for storing and retrieving variables in the device's non-volatile memory. This API is useful for saving and loading configuration settings, calibration data, and other persistent variables.

*The header file for this API is part of <GithubLink path="os/MatrixOS.h"/> and the implementation is in <GithubLink path="os/system/NVS.cpp"/>.*

## Saved Variables
The NVS API is rather complex requiring the use of a hash to identify variables. In most case you will want to use the [SavedVar Macro](./Utilities/SavedVarible)  to create saved variables instead of using the NVS API directly.

You will want to use the NVS API directly if you need to store a large amount of data like save the full configuration for Note layout after user is done configuring instead saving after every small changes with large numbers of saved variables.

## Hashing 
Need a way to hash the key to a unique value? Check out the [Hash Utility](./Utilities/Hash) for more information.


---

## `MatrixOS::NVS::GetSize`
```cpp
size_t GetSize(uint32_t hash);
```

Retrieves the size of the variable associated with the given hash.

**Parameters:**
- `hash` (`uint32_t`): The hash identifying the variable.

**Returns:**
- `size_t`: The size of the variable in bytes. If the variable does not exist, the returned size will be -1.

---

## `MatrixOS::NVS::GetVariable` (Overloaded)

### Version 1: Returns Variable Content
```cpp
vector<char> GetVariable(uint32_t hash);
```

Retrieves the content of the variable associated with the given hash as a `vector<char>`.

**Parameters:**
- `hash` (`uint32_t`): The hash identifying the variable.

**Returns:**
- `vector<char>`: The content of the variable. If the variable does not exist, the returned vector will be zero length.

---

### Version 2: Loads Variable into Pointer
```cpp
int8_t GetVariable(uint32_t hash, void* pointer, uint16_t length);
```

Loads the variable content into the provided pointer. If the variable is not defined, the function attempts to use the current value at the pointer to define the variable.

**Parameters:**
- `hash` (`uint32_t`): The hash identifying the variable.
- `pointer` (`void*`): A pointer to the memory location where the variable's content will be loaded.
- `length` (`uint16_t`): The size of the data to load.

**Returns:**
- `int8_t`: A status code indicating success or failure.

---

## `MatrixOS::NVS::SetVariable`
```cpp
bool SetVariable(uint32_t hash, void* pointer, uint16_t length);
```

Sets or updates the variable identified by the given hash with the content provided in the pointer.

**Parameters:**
- `hash` (`uint32_t`): The hash identifying the variable.
- `pointer` (`void*`): A pointer to the memory location containing the data to store.
- `length` (`uint16_t`): The size of the data to store.

**Returns:**
- `bool`: `true` if the operation was successful; `false` otherwise.

---

## `MatrixOS::NVS::DeleteVariable`
```cpp
bool DeleteVariable(uint32_t hash);
```

Deletes the variable associated with the given hash.

**Parameters:**
- `hash` (`uint32_t`): The hash identifying the variable.

**Returns:**
- `bool`: `true` if the variable was successfully deleted; `false` otherwise.

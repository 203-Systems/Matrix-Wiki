# Matrix OS Basics

Matrix OS is a cross-platform, real-time, extensible, smart operating system designed for controllers.

Matrix OS is community-centric, meaning it is fully open-sourced, allowing you to customize it to your needs or collaborate with the community to enhance it.

## Ways to Develop for Matrix OS

- **Create Matrix OS Applications**: Develop applications that run natively on Matrix OS.

- **Develop Matrix OS Remote Applications**: Build applications that run on more powerful devices and connect to Matrix OS devices and their applications.

<!-- idea: show examples -->

- **Enhance the Matrix OS Kernel**: Add features to the OS, write new libraries, and improve frameworks.

<!-- idea: link to examples -->

- **Port Matrix OS to Different Devices or Platforms**: Create your own Matrix OS device, port Matrix OS to third-party controllers, or add support for new SOCs.

<!-- idea: show examples, if not, POC -->

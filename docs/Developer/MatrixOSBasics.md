# Matrix OS Basics

Matrix OS is a cross-platform, real-time, extensible, smart operating system designed for controllers.

Matrix OS is community-centric, meaning it is fully open-sourced, allowing you to customize it to your needs or collaborate with the community to enhance it.

## Ways to Develop for Matrix OS

- **Create Matrix OS Python Applications**: Develop python applications that runs on Matrix OS. With Python based applications can share with the community easily.

<!-- idea: show examples -->

- **Create Matrix OS Applications**: Develop applications that run natively on Matrix OS. More involved and more complicated to share. But it enables you to use the full capability of your hardware. Ideal for high performance required applications.

- **Enhance the Matrix OS Kernel**: Add features to the OS, write new libraries, and improve frameworks.

<!-- idea: link to examples -->

- **Port Matrix OS to Different Devices or Platforms**: Create your own Matrix OS device, port Matrix OS to third-party controllers, or add support for new SOCs.

<!-- idea: show examples, if not, POC -->

# Code your application (C++)

## Native Application System Overview

In Matrix OS, native (C++) applications will be running on the device as it's own thread in the OS and have access to System API, device level low level API, and any third party library. This is great for performance but not great for portability and sharing. (hint hint)

The application code will be similar to the Arduino, which you will have an user defined Setup() for the initialization of your application, a user defined Loop() as infinite loop for your application code. Additionally, you will have a user defined End() for end of your application and a Exit() function that you can call to exit the application.

## Available API

- Matrix OS C++ API - Matrix OS provided APIs, they are the easiest to use, provides the best portability, and memory safe (supposedly).
- Device Layer API - Device layer provided API. Matrix OS API are largely a wrapper over those and you should be using them instead. There might be some non standard API for some special device features that have not been added into the Matrix OS API.
- FreeRTOS API - Matrix OS runs on FreeRTOS and you can use FreeRTOS API as well to create threads and cross thread communication. 
- Any third party C/C++ library you wish to use - You should be able to include them inside your application folder and use them.

:::warning[Non Stable API & Build system]
As this project is still evolving, I can not promise APIs will stay the same. There are constantly a lot of new usages that requires new API and changes of existing API. Your code will break, but I don't know when and how. I do try to maintain backward compatibility as much as possible but I won't try to save an obviously bad design.

Matrix OS build system might be receiving an overhaul soon so it will be smarter to know what to compile and what not to. Your code might need to change a bit to adapt to it, but it shouldn't be very hard and there will be migration guide.

## Example App

We use the example App in the Matrix OS the example to explain how the application works. You can find the source code at the [Matrix OS repo](https://github.com/203Null/MatrixOS/tree/WiFi-Example/applications/Example)

#### Break Down 


<SyntaxHighlighter language="cpp" style={vscDarkPlus}>
{`
#include "MatrixOS.h"
`} 
</SyntaxHighlighter>

This includes the MatrixOS.h file, which includes all the framework, type, and APIs provided by the Matrix OS.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="cpp" style={vscDarkPlus}>
{`
#include "applications/Application.h"" 
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

This include the Application.h file, which is the base class for all applications. It provides the basic structure for the application.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="cpp" style={vscDarkPlus}>
{`
#include "applications/BrightnessControl/BrightnessControl.h" 
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

This include the BrightnessControl.h file, which is an external UI for brightness control. This shows that you can include UI or UI elements from other applications. (Although it's not recommended)

{`
class ExampleAPP : public Application {
public:
static Application_Info info;

void Setup() override;
void Loop() override;
void End() override;
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

This is the class definition of the ExampleAPP class. It inherits from the Application class, which is the base class for all applications. 
The Application_Info info is a static variable that contains the meta data of the application. It includes the name, author, color, version, and visibility of the application. (See below for more info)

It also defines the override of Setup(), Loop(), and End() functions from the Application class. (If you don't need them, you can remove them and not override them. They will do nothing by default)

<SyntaxHighlighter language="cpp" style={vscDarkPlus}>
{`
uint8_t number = 0;
Color color = Color(0xFFFFFF);
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>
This is the variable definition of the number and color variable. They are used by the application to store the number and color at run time.

:::warning[Local variable only]
Make sure all your variables are within the class. If you define them outside of the class, they will be global variables and the memory will not be managed by the OS. This will cause memory to be taken even if the application is not running.
:::

<SyntaxHighlighter language="cpp" style={vscDarkPlus}>
{`
  CreateSavedVar("Example", number, uint8_t, 0);
  CreateSavedVar("Example", color, Color, Color(0xFFFFFF))
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>
If you want to save your variable between restarts, you can use the CreateSavedVar() macro.
This is the saved variable definition of the number and color variable. They are used by the application to store the number and color between restarts. 

The macro is defined as CreateSavedVar(namespace string, variable name, variable type, default value). 
- Namespace string is the name of the application. It is used to separate the saved variables between different applications. (You can technically use the same namespace to access the saved variables of another application, but it's not recommended)
- Variable name is the name of the variable. It is used to identify the variable in the saved variables. You also use this name to access the variable in the code.
- Variable type is the type of the variable. It is used to determine the size of the variable and how to save/load it.
- Default value is the default value of the variable. It is used to initialize the variable if it is not saved yet.

In most case when you are access the variable, you can just use the variable name as if it's a normal variable. The value will be saved & loaded automatically! For primitive types, you also will be able to use it in arithmetic operations.
If you have a complex variable, you might need to use .Get() to get a pointer to the variable, modifiy it, and then use .Save() to save it.

I know the macro is not very intuitive and it's not following C's syntex on varible creation. If you have a better idea, please let me know.

For more info on saved variable, see <DocLink to="/docs/Developer/MatrixOSApplicationCppAPI/Utilities/SavedVariable">Saved Variable</DocLink>

{`
  void UIMenu();
  void KeyEventHandler(uint16_t KeyID, KeyInfo* keyInfo);
  void MidiEventHandler(MidiPacket midiPacket);
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

This is the function definition of the UIMenu(), KeyEventHandler(), and MidiEventHandler() functions. They are used by the application to handle UI, key, and MIDI events. We will explain them in the source file section.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="cpp" style={vscDarkPlus}>

    .visibility = true,
};
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

This is the meta data of the application. It is used by the OS to display information about the application. It includes the name, author, color, version, and visibility of the application.

- Name - The name of the application. It is used to identify the application in the OS. (System will refer to the application by this name)
- Author - The author of the application. It is used to create namespaced between different authors. (So two applications with the same name but different authors won't conflict)
- Color - The color of the application. It is used to identify the application in the UI. (The color will be used in the UI to represent the application)
- Version - The version of the application. It is used to identify the version of the application. (The OS does not make use of this yet, but it will be helpful for APPs to keep track of their version and update it's NVS)
- Visibility - The visibility of the application. It is used to determine if the application is visible in the UI. (If the application is not visible, it will not be shown in the UI, but they can still be launched by ExecuteAPP() function.)

</SyntaxHighlighter>

This is the KeyEventHandler() function of the application. It is called when there is a key event. It is used to handle the key event.

It sets the LED color of the key to the color variable when the key is pressed. It sets the LED color of the key to off when the key is released. It opens the UI menu when the function key is pressed.

You will get a keyID as the id of the key of the event, and a KeyInfo struct as the information of the key event. The KeyInfo struct contains the state of the key event (PRESSED, HOLD, AFTERTOUCH, RELEASED) and the value of the key event.

You can use the MatrixOS API KEYPAD::ID2XY(id) to get the XY coordination of the keyID. If the bool(xy) == false or xy == Point.Invalid(), then the keyID is not a key on the grid. (It's a key with ID only). 

FUNCTION_KEY is an function key ID provided by device layer. In the case of Mystrix, it is the center key. All Mystrix OS device are required to have a FUNCTION_KEY or equivalent method of evoking it.

</SyntaxHighlighter>

This is the MidiEventHandler() function of the application. It is called when there is a MIDI event. It is used to handle the MIDI event.

First, it sends the MIDI packet back to the source. Then, it parses the MIDI packet and calls the corresponding handler function based on the status of the MIDI packet.

Each midi packet consists of:
- port - Where the MIDI signal is from (See EMidiPortID in MidiPacket.h). It indicates where the MIDI signal is from (USB, Bluetooth, RTPMIDI, HWPort, etc). When sending MIDI packets, this is also where the MIDI signal will be sent to. In this case, if a midi is coming from USB and it will be send back to USB. If a midi is coming from Bluetooth, it will be send back to Bluetooth. You can also send to multiple source by setting the port to EMidiPortID::MIDI_PORT_EACH_CLASS (send to first of each port type) or EMidiPortID::MIDI_PORT_ALL (send to all ports).
- status - The MIDI status (See EMidiStatus in MidiPacket.h). It indicates the type of the MIDI signal. In this case, it will call the NoteHandler() function if the status is NoteOn or ControlChange, and call the SysExHandler() function if the status is SysExData or SysExEnd.
- data - 3 byte of data. Contents of this data depends on the status. For example, if the status is NoteOn, the first byte is the channel, the second byte is the note, and the third byte is the velocity.

There are also alternative names for each data bytes for different status type. Like channel, note, velocity, etc. You can access them by calling the function of the same name. See

This is the UIMenu() function of the application. It is called when the function key is pressed. It is used to open the UI menu of the application.

It creates a UI object with the name "UI Menu" and the color 0x00FFFF. It creates a number selector button, a color selector button, and a brightness button. It sets the callback functions for the buttons and adds them to the UI object.

Finally after the UI object is fully set up, it starts the UI runtime to take over. The code will continue after the UI is exited. If the Exit() function is called in the UI, the code will start in the End() function of the application and then exit.

See the <DocLink to="/docs/Developer/MatrixOSApplicationCppAPI/UI/UIFramework">Matrix OS UI Framework</DocLink> for more details on how to create UIs and use the UI interface and elements.

This is the End() function of the application. It is called when the application is exited. It is used to clean up the application.

## Add the Application to the OS

To add the application to the OS, you need to add the application to the applications list in your device layer files. For Mystrix, the application list is the /devices/MatrixBlock6/Applications.h file.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="cpp" style={vscDarkPlus}>
{`
#pragma once

// SYSTEM_APPLICATION
#include "applications/Shell/Shell.h"
#include "applications/Performance/Performance.h"
#include "applications/Note/Note.h"
#include "applications/REDACTED/REDACTED.h"
#include "applications/Companion/Companion.h"

// USER APPLICATION
#include "applications/Lighting/Lighting.h"
#include "applications/Dice/Dice.h"
#include "applications/Gamepad/Gamepad.h"
#include "applications/Example/Example.h" // <- Add your application here
#include "applications/Reversi/Reversi.h"

// BOOT ANIMATION
#include "applications/Mystrix/MystrixBoot/MystrixBoot.h"

// DEVICE APPLICATION
#include "applications/Mystrix/FactoryMenu/FactoryMenu.h"
#include "applications/Mystrix/ForceCalibration/ForceCalibration.h"

#define OS_SHELL APPID("203 Systems", "Shell")
#define DEFAULT_BOOTANIMATION APPID("203 Systems", "Mystrix Boot")
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Add your application to the USER APPLICATION section of the file. Simply include the header file of your application. (In this case, it is "applications/Example/Example.h")

In the Matrix OS application launcher, the order of the applications in the list is the order they will be displayed in the UI. You can change the order of the applications by changing the order of the applications in the file.


## Your Application as Submodule

You can create your Application in it's own repository and include it as a submodule in the Matrix OS repository. This way, you can develop your application separately and different builds can include it as external module.

We are also working on standardized this process so you can easily include your application in the Matrix OS build system. We might also release an webapp that can help you create a Matrix OS build with different applications you want to include!

## Things to Note

- Make sure all your variables are within the class. If you define them outside of the class, they will be global variables and the memory will not be managed by the OS. This will cause memory to be taken even if the application is not running.
- If you use dynamic memory allocation, make sure to free the memory when the application is exiting. The OS can only recycle the static memory in the application stack, not the dynamic memory that you or your variables allocated.
- If you used anything advanced, like threads, mutex, etc or hardware changes like peripheral configuration and start up. Make sure to clean them up or undo them when the application is exiting.

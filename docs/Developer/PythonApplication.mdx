# Code your application (Python)

:::warning Development Status
Python support and Matrix OS API is in preview release for OS 3.0.
We welcome community to play when them and report back any issue they see with them.
:::

## Writing Python Apps

There are two ways to use Python for MatrixOS:

### Method 1: Python REPL - Testing & experimenting
Use the Python app in the application launcher to access a Python REPL through USB serial. This is great for testing and rapid prototyping.

### Method 2: Standalone Application - For saving and sharing
Create a standalone Python application by placing your files in the device storage. This is great for saving your work and share with others.

:::warning Micro SD Card Required
A Micro SD card must be installed in your device to use standalone Python applications. See [Install Micro SD Card](../Mystrix/InstallMicroSD) for installation instructions.
:::

## Creating a Standalone Application

### File Structure
Place your application files in the device storage:
```
/MatrixOS/Applications/<appname>/
```

Your application folder must contain:
- Your Python script files (`.py`)
- An `AppInfo.json` configuration file

### AppInfo.json

The `AppInfo.json` file defines your application's metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "Hello World",
  "author": "203 Systems",
  "color": [255, 0, 0],
  "version": 1,
  "osMinimalVer": [3, 0, 0],
  "appMainFile": "HelloWorld.py"
}
```

**Required fields:**
- `name`: Your application's display name
- `author`: Your name or organization
- `color`: RGB color array [R, G, B] for the app icon (0-255)
- `version`: Application version number
- `osMinimalVer`: Minimum MatrixOS version required [major, minor, patch]
- `appMainFile`: The main Python file to execute (can be `.py` for source code or `.py.a` for compiled Python code)

## Clear Compiled Byte Code

Matrix OS will auto pick compiled bytecode over raw .py files. So if you updated the .py file, make sure to delete the `/MatrixOS/Applications/<appname>/pikapython-api` folder to force recompile.

## Example Applications

# Code your application (Python)

## Writing Python Apps

There are two ways to write Python applications for MatrixOS:

### Method 1: Python REPL
Use the Python app in the application launcher to access a Python REPL through USB serial. This is great for testing and rapid prototyping.

### Method 2: Standalone Application
Create a standalone Python application by placing your files in the device storage.

## Creating a Standalone Application

### File Structure
Place your application files in the device storage:
```
/MatrixOS/Applications/<appname>/
```

Your application folder must contain:
- Your Python script files (`.py`)
- An `AppInfo.json` configuration file

### AppInfo.json

The `AppInfo.json` file defines your application's metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "Hello World",
  "author": "203 System",
  "color": [255, 0, 0],
  "version": 1,
  "osMinimalVer": [3, 0, 0],
  "appMainFile": "HelloWorld.py"
}
```

**Required fields:**
- `name`: Your application's display name
- `author`: Your name or organization
- `color`: RGB color array [R, G, B] for the app icon (0-255)
- `version`: Application version number
- `osMinimalVer`: Minimum MatrixOS version required [major, minor, patch]
- `appMainFile`: The main Python file to execute

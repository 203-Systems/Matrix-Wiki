# Building on Linux

:::warning[Unverified Guide]
I (Null) don't use Linux for development but I was able to get Matrix OS to build on Linux via WSL and Github Action.

Since I mainly do develop on Windows, the code base might also have case sensitive issues that prevents it from build build on Linux/MacOS.

If you have suggestions or questions, please reach out in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rRVCBHHPfw), [Github issue](https://github.com/203-Systems/Matrix-Wiki), or a leave a comment on this page.

## Install Git

Git is necessary for cloning the Matrix OS repository. Install Git with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
git --version
```

## Install Make

Make is essential for building Matrix OS. Install it using:

```bash
sudo apt install make
```

Confirm the installation:

```bash
make --version
```

## Clone the Matrix OS Repository

1. Make sure Git is installed as shown above.

2. Open your terminal.

3. Clone the Matrix OS repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/203-Systems/MatrixOS.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd MatrixOS
   ```

5. Initialize the submodules in the Matrix OS repository:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init
   ```

## Install ESP-IDF

The ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) is required to build and upload Matrix OS to the Mystrix device.

1. Download and install ESP-IDF version **V5.3.1**. Follow the instructions on [ESP-IDF: Standard Setup of Toolchain for Linux](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/linux-setup.html) to install version V5.3.1.

2. After installation, locate the installation directory (e.g., `~/esp`).

3. Run the `install.sh` script to complete the setup:

   ```bash
   ~/esp/esp-idf/install.sh
   ```

## Build Matrix OS

1. Load ESP-IDF by sourcing it in your terminal session:

   ```bash
   source ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
   ```

    In the long run, you will want to automate this. You could add this line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) or if you are using VS Code, you can modify the MatrixOS.code-workspace file and adapt it to run it on new terminal.

2. Navigate to the Matrix OS root folder if your terminal isnâ€™t already there.

3. Run the following command to build Matrix OS:

   ```bash
   make DEVICE=Mystrix build
   ```

4. Prepare for the upload by ensuring your Mystrix is in <DocLink to="/docs/Mystrix/UpdateMatrixOS#enter-os-update-mode">upload mode</DocLink>.

5. Install `psutil` (only needed once):

   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

6. Upload the compiled Matrix OS to your Mystrix device:

   ```bash
   make DEVICE=Mystrix uf2-upload
   ```

7. Your Mystrix device should now flash and start the newly compiled Matrix OS automatically.

## Build Commands

Here are some useful build commands you can use in Matrix OS:

- `clean` - Cleans the build.
- `fullclean` - Cleans the build more thoroughly. Use this if you encounter undefined references or missing files.
- `build` - Builds Matrix OS based on the default config (OS/parameter.h).
- `build-release`, `build-rc`, `build-beta`, `build-nightly`, `build-dev` - Builds Matrix OS in various modes. `build-dev` enables USB logging (see <DocLink to="/docs/Developer/DebugMatrixOSCpp">Debug Matrix OS</DocLink>).

You can chain commands together like:
```bash
make DEVICE=Mystrix clean build uf2-upload
```

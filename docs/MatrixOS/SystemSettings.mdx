## Rotate Device
Rotates the device so that the top of the device is on the specified side.

Some device control are asmymetrical, some controls might not work or function differently when the device in different rotation. 

(eg. in performance app with Mystrix. The touchbar will be mapped differently when the device is rotated, since there are only two touchbars on the device.)

## Brightness Control
You can tap the brightness control pad to cycle through brightness levels. In addition, you can hold the brightness control pad to enter the brightness control menu.

### Brightness Control Menu

## Factory Reset
Factory resets the device.

You will have to confirm the factory reset by clicking on the green pad to proceed.

## Device ID
Assign a device ID to the device. The ID will show up on host after the device's name. This is useful for identifying the device with you have multiple devices connected to the same host.

If set to zero, the device ID will not show up on the host.

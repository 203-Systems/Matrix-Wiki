# Performance App

The Performance App serves as a user canvas for standard MIDI signals.

When you first enter the application, you will see a blank canvas. You can click or hold the function key to enter the action menu.

To exit the Performance App, enter the action menu and hold down the function key. You will be brought back to the <DocLink to="/docs/MatrixOS/ApplicationLauncher">application launcher</DocLink>. This is the standard method for exiting an app in Matrix OS.

## Performance Canvas

The Performance Canvas is the main interface where you interact with the grid to send MIDI signals.

It can be used for visual performances with Amethyst Player, Ableton Live, or Unipad; as a drum pad in any MIDI-enabled DAW; or as a canvas for your own DAW integration via the standard MIDI protocol.

The canvas sends standard MIDI signals with aftertouch, ensuring compatibility with any DAW that accepts MIDI when used as a drum pad. Each key on the grid can trigger MIDI notes with velocity and pressure sensitivity.

To access the Action Menu, tap or hold the function key depending on your Menu Lock setting.

### Detect Action Menu State on Host Applications

The Performance App will send out a CC signal when the action menu is entered (`channel 1`, `CC 121`, value `127` for enter, value `0` for exit).

## Note Layout

:::note
Please note that the Mystrix device family has two touchbars on the left and right. However, the device can be rotated to have the touchbars on the top and bottom.

In this orientation, the right touchbar will be mapped to the top touchbar, and the left touchbar will be mapped to the bottom touchbar. Note that the LED MIDI input note is separated for the two touchbars' MIDI output note.
:::

![Performance App Keymap](PerformanceKeymap.svg)

### Touch Combo Keys

Touch Combo Keys provide an alternative way to use the Mystrix's touchbar.

By default, the 16 touchbars are mapped to 16 MIDI notes. When Touch Combo Keys are enabled, holding any touch key will map the left and right columns of the keypad to the left and right touchbar's original note.

This means that holding down the touch key will act as a note shift for the two columns, making them function as a touchbar, similar to how the control key works on a computer keyboard.

## Flicker Reduction

Flicker Reduction is used when MIDI lightshows cause flickering or when the light speed exceeds the device's refresh rate. It is recommended to enable this feature only when Mystrix is used with Ableton Live.

## Menu Lock

Menu Lock prevents accidental entry into the action menu by requiring the function key to be held for a longer duration before the menu opens.

## Color Palette

There are two built-in color palettes and four custom color palettes.

You can edit the custom color palettes in the action menu.

### Upload Custom Palette

You can upload four custom palettes to the app for channels 3, 4, 5, and 6. You can edit the custom palettes in the action menu or upload custom palettes.

Community member Dovitate has created a custom palette uploader Max Patch for the Performance App. You can find it at [203 Systems Discord - Community Release](https://discord.com/channels/503413248704380930/1266490246770462770).

You can find more custom palettes on [Kaskobi's website](https://www.kaskobi.com/palettes).

## SysEx API

The SysEx API provides more advanced control over the canvas than regular MIDI signals, including real RGB LED color and faster LED fill.

The Mystrix SysEx header is:

> 0xF0 0x00 0x02 0x03 0x4D 0x58

### RGB LED Color - 0x5E

The RGB LED color command is used to set the color of the LED on the canvas.

The command is:

> `Header` 0x5E `POS` `R` `G` `B` [`POS2` `R` `G` `B`] [`POS3` `R` `G` `B`] ... 0xF7

- `POS` is the position of the LED on the canvas. It's Y \* 10 + X. The (1, 1) is the lower corner of the grid and (8, 8) is the top right corner. You can access the underglow by using X Y 0 or 8. Additionally, you can do a global fill by using pos 0, row fill by 100 + Y, and column fill by 110 + X.
- `R`, `G`, `B` are the red, green, and blue values of the LED. The value is 0-63.

You can repeat the `POS R G B` (for a reasonable amount of times) to set multiple LEDs at once.

### RGB LED Color Batch Fill - 0x5F

The RGB LED color batch fill command is used to set the color of the LED on the canvas in a faster way.

The command is:

> `Header` 0x5F `R` `G` `B` `POS` [`POS2`] [`POS3`] [`POS4`] ... 0xF7

- `R`, `G`, `B` are the red, green, and blue values of the LED. The value is 0-63.
- `POS` is the position of the LED on the canvas. It's Y \* 10 + X. The (1, 1) is the lower corner of the grid and (8, 8) is the top right corner. You can access the underglow by using X Y 0 or 8. Additionally, you can do a global fill by using pos 0, row fill by 100 + Y, and column fill by 110 + X.

You can repeat the `POS` (for a reasonable amount of times) to set multiple LEDs at once.

### Upload Custom Palette - 0x41

The Upload Custom Palette command is used to customize LED color palettes. The process includes three subcommands (`0x7B`, `0x3D`, and `0x7D`), allowing for initialization, data upload, and finalization. The command structure is as follows:

The command is:

> `Header` 0x41 SubCommand Data ... 0xF7

- **SubCommand**: Specifies the stage of the upload process:
  - `0x7B`: Uploading Start
  - `0x3D`: Uploading Write
  - `0x7D`: Uploading End

#### **Uploading Start (0x7B)**

Marks the beginning of the palette upload process.

> `Header` 0x41 0x7B 0xF7

#### **Uploading Write (0x3D)**

Writes color data to the specified palette.

> `Header` 0x41 0x3D `PaletteID` `Index` `R` `G` `B` [`PaletteID2` `Index2` `R` `G` `B`] ... 0xF7

- `PaletteID`: Specifies the target palette (0-3).
- `Index`: The slot in the palette to update (0-127).
- `R, G, B`: The red, green, and blue components of the color (0-63).

The RGB values are remapped from 6-bit to 8-bit resolution internally for enhanced color precision.

#### **Uploading End (0x7D)**

Completes the palette upload process and saves the changes to non-volatile storage.

> `Header` 0x41 0x7D 0xF7

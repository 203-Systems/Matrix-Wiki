## Web Editor

You can create custom control maps via the [Matrix OS Custom Control Map Editor](https://edit.203.io)

You can assign actions and effect to keys. You can also assign multiple actions to a single key and they will be executed in sequence.

### Action 

An action is a single operation that can be performed by the key action.

### Effect
An effect is a visual feedback that is displayed on the key when the action is performed, it can be triggered via key action or other events.



:::warning
Documents are still in progress. Things are pretty easy to understand except a few things.

- Action Driven Color is linking color to action state. In MiDi if you selected the toggle option, the color 1 of action driven color will be used if toggle is at on position.

There are also some bugs that I will be fixing before release, for example the sysex is currently not working.

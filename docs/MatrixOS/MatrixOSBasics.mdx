# Matrix OS Basics

## Application System
Matrix OS is the soul of the Mystrix or other compatible devices, enabling them to be smart controller with multi model connectivity and enhanced standalone capabilities. All software features are shipped as Matrix OS applications and be completely independent of each other.

All user features on Matrix OS are provided as separate applications. In this wiki only stock applications are covered. Some third party applications might have their own manual.

## Booting Up
After connecting your device to power, a boot animation will start playing. If Matrix OS can not connect to the host (eg, connected to a power bank), a standby animation will be playing in loop. You can click the center function key to enter the OS.

After the boot animation, the [application launcher](/docs/MatrixOS/ApplicationLauncher) will be the first thing that the OS shows.


## User Interface

In most of Matrix OS UI, you can hold down any light up buttons to see their name or meaning. Holding down any unlit keys will show the current menu name.

Some lit keys will have more advanced control panel if held down (eg, brightness control). In that case, you can hold down the unlit keys in the advance control to see the meaning for the button.

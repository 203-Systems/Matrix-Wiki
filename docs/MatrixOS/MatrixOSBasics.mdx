# Matrix OS Basics

## Application System

Matrix OS is the core operating system for Mystrix and other compatible devices, transforming them into smart controllers with multi-modal connectivity and enhanced standalone capabilities. All software features are delivered as independent Matrix OS applications.

This documentation covers only the stock applications. Some third-party applications may have their own manuals.

## Booting Up

After connecting your device to power, a boot animation will start playing. If Matrix OS cannot connect to the host (e.g., is connected to a power bank), a standby animation will loop. You can click the center function key to enter the OS.

After the boot animation, the [application launcher](/docs/MatrixOS/ApplicationLauncher) will be the first screen displayed by the OS.

## User Interface

In most of the Matrix OS UI, you can hold down any lit buttons to see their name or function. Holding down any unlit keys will show the current menu name.

Some lit keys will have more advanced control panels if held down (e.g., [brightness control](/docs/MatrixOS/SystemSettings#brightness-control)). In such cases, you can hold down the unlit keys in the advanced control panel to see the function of each button.

## Exit App

Matrix OS provides two methods to exit applications and return to the home screen:

### Standard Exit Method
1. **Enter the app's action/config menu** by tapping the Function Key (center key)
2. **Hold down the Function Key** while in the menu to exit the application

This is the recommended method as it allows the application to properly clean up and save any necessary data.

### Emergency Exit Method
If you get stuck in an application or need to force exit:

**Hold down the Function Key for 3 seconds** to immediately return to the home screen.

:::warning Emergency Exit
The 3-second force exit works system-wide across all applications. Use this when the standard exit method is not available or when you're lost in an application's interface.

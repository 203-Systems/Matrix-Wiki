# Welcome to Mystrix

Mystrix is a multipurpose grid controller, designed to be community-centric, highly customizable, and fully open-sourced.

<!-- idea: very cool intro/hero image here -->

## Getting Started

### Install the Anti-Slip Pad

<!-- idea: video here would be perfect -->

The first thing you should do is apply the included silicon anti-slip pad from the packaging to your Mystrix.

<!-- idea: image of the label -->

We are unable to install it in the factory due to regulatory reasons, as we need to conceal the metal device information label under the pad to keep it clean and prevent wear and scratches.

:::note
If you have an alternate Function Key you want to install (like the one that came with the Kickstarter), make sure you install this prior to installing the anti-slip pad.
:::

:::warning
Some magnets under the device might have come loose during shipping. You can glue them back on or just place them in and then apply the anti-slip pad.
However, make sure the polarity of the magnets are facing the same way. The side of the magnet with the dried glue should face the device and not the anti-slip pad.
:::

To install the anti-slip pad, turn the Mystrix face down and peel the clear protective sheet off the bottom. Align the anti-slip pad (making sure the curved edge is aligned with the pogo pins) and press firmly.

## Expectations

<!-- idea: idk how to rewrite this in a better way lmao -->

There are a lot of things Mystrix can do and is capable of, but it's important to set the correct expectations.

- No, you don't need programming skills to use or even tinker with Mystrix.
- Yes, some features might not be relevant to your specific needs. We are not trying to appeal to a specific group of people, but rather making Mystrix versatile so it can be used by anyone for whatever needs they have. Having options is a good thing!
- Yes, Project Mystrix is an ongoing process. There are many things we want to improve, and there are still some rough edges. With your help, it will continue to evolve! We are here to listen and improve based on your feedback!

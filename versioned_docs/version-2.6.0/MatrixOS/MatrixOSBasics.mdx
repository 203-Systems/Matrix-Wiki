# Matrix OS Basics

## Application System

Matrix OS is the core operating system for Mystrix and other compatible devices, transforming them into smart controllers with multi-modal connectivity and enhanced standalone capabilities. All software features are delivered as independent Matrix OS applications.

This documentation covers only the stock applications. Some third-party applications may have their own manuals.

## Booting Up

After connecting your device to power, a boot animation will start playing. If Matrix OS cannot connect to the host (e.g., is connected to a power bank), a standby animation will loop. You can click the center function key to enter the OS.

After the boot animation, the <DocLink to="/docs/MatrixOS/ApplicationLauncher">application launcher</DocLink> will be the first screen displayed by the OS.

## User Interface

In most of the Matrix OS UI, you can hold down any lit buttons to see their name or function. Holding down any unlit keys will show the current menu name.

Some lit keys will have more advanced control panels if held down (e.g., <DocLink to="/docs/MatrixOS/SystemSettings#brightness-control">brightness control</DocLink>). In such cases, you can hold down the unlit keys in the advanced control panel to see the function of each button.

# Class: `UI4pxNumber`

The `UI4pxNumber` class represents a compact numeric display component for UI systems. It renders numbers in a 4-pixel-hight format with configurable color, digit count, and spacing.

:::info[Things to note]
Each digit takes up 3 pixels in width. With zero gap it will take up 9 pixels. Usually this means it doesn't fit in 8 width grid. However, digit 1 takes up 1 pixel and digit 2 takes up 2 pixels. So technically you can fit 0 to 299 in 8 width grid.

Also since the number is hard to read in a 0 gap setting, that's why the alternative color is used to make them easier to separate and read.
:::

:::warning[Negative Numbers]
Currently, the component does not support rendering negative numbers. This functionality may be added in the future. 

However there's a work around. See <GithubLink path="applications\Mystrix\ForceCalibration\ForceCalibration.cpp"/> 's minusSign implementation in the SetOffset function.

## Constructor

### `UI4pxNumber`
```cpp
UI4pxNumber(Color color, uint8_t digits, int32_t* value, Color alternative_color = Color(0xFFFFFF), uint8_t spacing = 0);
```

Creates a new 4-pixel number display component.

**Parameters:**
- `color` ([`Color`](../../Types/Color/)): The primary color for the digits.
- `digits` (`uint8_t`): The total number of digits to display.
- `value` (`int32_t*`): Pointer to the integer value to be displayed.
- `alternative_color` ([`Color`](../../Types/Color/), optional): Secondary color for alternating digit styling. Defaults to white (`0xFFFFFF`).
- `spacing` (`uint8_t`, optional): Horizontal spacing between digits. Defaults to `0`.

---

## Methods

### `GetSize`
```cpp
virtual Dimension GetSize();
```
Calculates the dimensions of the number display based on the number of digits and spacing.

**Returns:**
- [[`Dimension`](../../Types/Dimension/)](../../Types/Dimension/): The dimensions (`width` and `height`) of the component.

---

### `GetColor`
```cpp
virtual Color GetColor();
```
Retrieves the primary color of the component.

**Returns:**
- [`Color`](../../Types/Color/): The primary color.

---

### `GetAlternativeColor`
```cpp
virtual Color GetAlternativeColor();
```
Retrieves the alternative color used for alternating digit styling. If no alternative color is set, the primary color is returned.

**Returns:**
- [`Color`](../../Types/Color/): The alternative color.

---

### `Render4pxNumber`
```cpp
void Render4pxNumber(Point origin, Color color, uint8_t value);
```
Renders a single 4-pixel digit at the specified position.

**Parameters:**
- `origin` ([`Point`](../../Types/Point/)): The top-left corner where the digit will be rendered.
- `color` ([`Color`](../../Types/Color/)): The color to use for the digit.
- `value` (`uint8_t`): The digit value to render (`0-9`, or `10` for blank).

---

### `Render`
```cpp
virtual bool Render(Point origin);
```
Renders the entire number at the specified position, handling digit placement, color alternation, and spacing.

**Parameters:**
- `origin` ([`Point`](../../Types/Point/)): The top-left corner where the number will be rendered.

**Returns:**
- `bool`: `true` if rendering was successful.

---

## Notes
- The component dynamically calculates significant figures for the number.
- The `Render` method alternates digit colors between `color` and `alternative_color` if specified.
- Currently, the component does not support rendering negative numbers. This functionality may be added in the future.

# Class: `UISelector`

The `UISelector` class provides a UI component for selecting a single item from a grid. It highlights the selected item, supports optional callbacks on selection, and allows for custom name display during hold events.

*The source file for this class is located in <GithubLink path="os/ui/UIComponents/UISelector.h"/>.*

## Constructor

### `UISelector`
```cpp
UISelector(Dimension dimension, string name, Color color, uint16_t count, uint16_t* value, std::function<void(uint16_t)> callback = nullptr);
```

Creates a new UISelector component.

**Parameters:**
- `dimension` ([`Dimension`](../../Types/Dimension/)): The grid size of the selector.
- `name` (`string`): The name of the selector, displayed during hold events.
- `color` [`Color`](../../Types/Color/): The color for the selector.
- `count` (`uint16_t`): The number of selectable items.
- `value` (`uint16_t*`): Pointer to the variable that stores the currently selected item's index.
- `callback` (`std::function<void(uint16_t)>`, optional): A callback function invoked when an item is selected. Defaults to `nullptr`.

## Methods

### `GetColor`
```cpp
virtual Color GetColor();
```
Retrieves the color of the selector.

**Returns:**
- [`Color`](../../Types/Color/): The color of the selector.

---

### `SetColor`
```cpp
void SetColor(Color color);
```
Sets the color of the selector.

**Parameters:**
- `color` [`Color`](../../Types/Color/): The new color for the selector.

---

### `GetSize`
```cpp
virtual Dimension GetSize();
```
Calculates the dimensions of the selector grid.

**Returns:**
- [`Dimension`](../../Types/Dimension/): The dimensions (`width` and `height`) of the selector.

---

### `Render`
```cpp
virtual bool Render(Point origin);
```
Renders the selector grid, highlighting the currently selected item.

**Parameters:**
- `origin` ([`Point`](../../Types/Point/)): The top-left corner of the rendering area.

**Returns:**
- `bool`: `true` if rendering was successful.

**Behavior:**
- Items greater than the count are unlit.
- The currently selected item is fully lit, while others are dimmed.

---

### `KeyEvent`
```cpp
virtual bool KeyEvent(Point xy, KeyInfo* keyInfo);
```
Handles key events for selecting items and displaying the selector's name during hold events.

**Parameters:**
- `xy` ([`Point`](../../Types/Point/)): The position of the event relative to the selector grid.
- `keyInfo` ([`KeyInfo*`](../../Types/KeyInfo/)): Information about the key event.

**Behavior:**
- **Hold**: Displays the `name` of the selector in a scrolling text format.
- **Released**: Updates the `value` to the selected item's index and invokes the `callback`, if defined.

**Returns:**
- `bool`: `true` to indicate the event was handled.

# Struct: `KeyInfo`

The `KeyInfo` struct represents the state and properties of a key of the device.

*The source file for this class is located in <GithubLink path="os/framework/KeyInfo.h"/>*

---

## Enumerations

### `KeyState`
Represents the possible states of a key.

**Values:**
- `IDLE`: The key is not active.
- `ACTIVATED`: The key is active but not generating events.
- `PRESSED`: The key has been pressed.
- `RELEASED`: The key has been released.
- `HOLD`: The key is being held down.
- `AFTERTOUCH`: The key is generating aftertouch events.
- `DEBUNCING`: The key is being debounced after activation.
- `RELEASE_DEBUNCING`: The key is being debounced after release.
- `INVALID`: Placeholder state for invalid keys.

---

## Member Variables

### `state`
```cpp
KeyState state = IDLE;
```

The current state of the key.

---

### `lastEventTime`
```cpp
uint32_t lastEventTime = 0;
```

The timestamp of the last key event (`PRESSED` or `RELEASED`).

---

### `velocity`
```cpp
Fract16 velocity = 0;
```

The velocity of the keypress.

---

### `hold`
```cpp
bool hold = false;
```

Indicates whether the key is currently held down.

---

### `cleared`
```cpp
bool cleared = false;
```

Indicates whether the key has been cleared for event generation.

---

## Member Functions

### `holdTime`
```cpp
uint32_t holdTime(void);
```

Calculates the time the key has been held down.

**Returns:**
- `uint32_t`: The hold duration in milliseconds. Returns `0` if the key is not active or the timing is invalid.

---

### `active`
```cpp
bool active();
```

Checks if the key is active (e.g., `ACTIVATED`, `AFTERTOUCH`, or `RELEASE_DEBUNCING`).

**Returns:**
- `bool`: `true` if the key is active, otherwise `false`.

---

### `Clear`
```cpp
void Clear();
```

Clears the key, preventing it from generating further events until its state changes.

---

## Device Layer API

### `update`
```cpp
bool update(KeyConfig& config, Fract16 new_velocity);
```

Updates the key's state based on new input velocity and configuration.

**Parameters:**
- `config` (`KeyConfig&`): The configuration for debouncing, thresholds, and velocity curves.
- `new_velocity` (`Fract16`): The new input velocity.

**Returns:**
- `bool`: `true` if the state has generated a new event, otherwise `false`.
